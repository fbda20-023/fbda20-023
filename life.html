  <h2>LIFESTYLE OF STOCKHOLM</h2>
  <P>Outdoor activities are very important to Stockholmers, whether it’s skiing, ice­skating and sledding in the winter or barbecues, watersports and nature walks in the summer. Public access to the countryside is protected by law, so you can make the most of the beautiful forests, islands and rivers. Despite its high latitude, the weather is fairly sunny – Stockholm has more hours of sunshine in an average year than London or Paris. There are many bus tours you can take to explore different aspects of the city which can be found in The Ultimate Stockholm Guide for Tours.Stockholm has many excellent galleries and museums with affordable entry fees, due to state support. It also has a vibrant music scene and its own literature festival. The Stockholm underground is known as the world’s longest art gallery (110km long), since most stations are adorned with sculptures, mosaics, paintings, installations, engravings or reliefs – the work of 150 different artists. Sweden is of course also known for textile and interior design, combining function with aesthetics.</P>
