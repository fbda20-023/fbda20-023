        <h2>New Year</h2>
        <p>In Stockholm the welcome of the New Year is celebrated by means of a pyrotechnic event with fireworks launching over the city. In recent years the location has moved due to the works around Slussen.New Year is celebrated with fireworks, starting at midnight on New Year's Day, and sparkling wine and many snacks, usually after a shellfish dinner late on New Year's Eve. In recent years, many people start the fireworks already on New Year's Eve or even many days before.</p>

        <h2>﻿Christmas</h2>
        <p>In most Swedish towns and cities, including Stockholm, there are processions of young people dressed in white and carrying candles, led by a young girl wearing a crown of candles. There is much singing involved in the celebrations, making for quite the spectacle.Each Sunday until Christmas, a candle is lit (and blown out after a while), until all four candles are alight. And on each of these Sundays, many Swedes enjoy glögg – a hot, spicy mulled wine with blanched almonds and raisins – and pepparkakor (gingerbread biscuits).</p>
