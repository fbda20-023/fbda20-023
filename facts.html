        <h2>The World's Smallest Big City.</h2>
        <p>Stockholm boasts an elegant ambiance with a beautiful design of historic influence preserved along the edge of the water. Instead of one, solid city, Stockholm is spread across 14 islands connected by 57 bridges. As the capital of Sweden, Stockholm acts as a microcosm of the surrounding country conserving the heritage while also constantly innovating through art, architecture, and balancing traditional style with forward-looking aesthetics. These are captured in spaces like the subway, which is often considered the world’s longest art gallery hosting gorgeous mosaics, elaborate sculptures, and fascinating paintings inside the majority of the stations.</p>

        <h2>The Riddarholmen Church</h2>
        <p>Riddarholmen Church is the church of a former medieval abbey in Stockholm, Sweden. The church serves as the final resting place of most Swedish monarchs. Riddarholmen Church is located on the island of Riddarholmen, close to the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden.The church has a long history which stretches back to 1270, when a Franciscan priory was founded on what is now Riddarholm. The Franciscan order was established in Italy in the early 13th century by Francis of Assisi, and came to Sweden in the 1220s. Here, the order was also known as the Greyfriars, in reference to the grey habits worn by the monks. The work involved in building the actual church probably began some years later, but we can conclude that construction was probably under way by 1285. </p>

        <h2>catastrophic plague</h2>
        <p>During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), many towns and areas around the Baltic Sea and East-Central Europe had a severe outbreak of the plague with a peak from 1708 to 1712. This epidemic was probably part of a pandemic affecting an area from Central Asia to the Mediterranean. Most probably via Constantinople, it spread to Pińczów in southern Poland, where it was first recorded in a Swedish military hospital in 1702. The plague then followed trade, travel and army routes, reached the Baltic coast at Prussia in 1709, affected areas all around the Baltic Sea by 1711 and reached Hamburg by 1712. Therefore, the course of the war and the course of the plague mutually affected each other: while soldiers and refugees were often agents of the plague, the death toll in the military as well as the depopulation of towns and rural areas sometimes severely impacted the ability to resist enemy forces or to supply troops.</p>
